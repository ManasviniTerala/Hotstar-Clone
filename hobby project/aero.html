            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>Aeronautical engineers have a highly technical job of designing aircrafts, missiles, satellites, space crafts, jet planes etc. They have to consider the smallest precision degree, and this makes their work complex and challenging. After designing of the crafts, they are also in responsibility to ensure successful and unbiased testing of the design. Aerospace engineers are employed primarily in manufacturing, analysis and design, research and development, and the federal government. They work to improve the flight safety and experience while reducing the cost of flying, the use of fuel and address the challenges that arise. They also work with aircraft that operates in space such as robots and satellites.</p>
